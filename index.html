        </div>
        <p>Samuel J. Porcello (May 23, 1935 – May 12, 2012) was an American food scientist who worked at Nabisco for 34 years. He is particularly noted for his work on the modern Oreo cookie. Porcello held five patents directly related to the Oreo. In particular, Porcello was the inventor of the white Oreo cookie creme-filling. His work earned him the nickname, "Mr. Oreo." Porcello was born and raised in Newark, New Jersey. He also lived in Wayne, New Jersey. He and his family moved to Toms River, New Jersey, in 1974, where he resided for the rest of his life. Porcello initially worked as a teacher for a short time during his early career. He then worked for the former The Charms Company, a candy manufacturer. He was nearly hired by a major cosmetics company, but his candidacy ended when the company learned that Porcello was color blind.</p>

        <h1>Providence Animal Center Pet of the Week: Oreo (posted around noon on 7/7/2021)</h1>
        <div class="Line"></div>
        <h2>Oreo is a sweet yet shy young adult cat who is waiting on her purr-fect match at Providence Animal Center, in Media. Do you think that could be you?! She is 16 pounds of sweetness, and aptly named for her beautiful black and white coat. Oreo loves to lounge her days away in a comfortable spot, and getting gentle head pets. While she is very sweet, she likes to take new introductions slowly, so she will benefit from living with a family that can respect her boundaries. Oreo is the packaged deal- she is spayed, microchipped, litterbox trained, and up-to-date on her vaccinations. PAC IS BACK! You can now walk-in to meet the adoptable cats at Providence Animal Center from Tuesday-Sunday – no appointment necessary.
        </h2>
